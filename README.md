# FinalProject for Javafx
###### Jawad Haider

## Project Description:
I tried to build a simple calculator and then added few other functionalities. 
As a simple calculator my calculator can do all the basic arithmetics like addition, subtraction, multiplication, divison, modulus. 
However, the new feature this calculator has is the histroy view. In Historyview you can see all your work with all the outputs. Moreover, you can clear your history as well. 
Other than that, the calculator is also easy to use, becuase if you have enter some wrong value you can delete it and enter it again. On the other hand if you want to clear a whole expression you can also do that by using the clear button.

## Software Requirements & Installation instructions:
1. Scene Builder installation
[Official site](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) to download Scene Builder.

2. [Official site](https://openjfx.io/) of JavaFX where you can find official documentation as well as download links.
Step-by-step [instructions](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/) on how to install and run JavaFX applications.


=>Add to VM option in intelliJ. --module-path ${PATH_TO_JAVAFX} --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

## Planned App's features list
Basic Arithmetic Operaitons.
* Two views/Screens: 
                    1. for the expression typed 
                     2. for the answer.
* A History view for checking how much operations were done.
* A delete Button to delete just one button.
* A Clear Button to clear all the expression.
* A part from basic Arithmetic operations like -,+,*,/. 
* Some other operations were also added like Mod, Basic Trig functions Tan, Sin, Cos.

## List of completed features
Basic Arithmetic Operaitons.

                    1. for the expression typed 
                     2. for the answer.

* A Clear Button to clear all the expression.
* A part from basic Arithmetic operations like -,+,*,/. 
* Some other operations were also added like Mod, Basic Trig functions Tan, Sin, Cos.


## List of features yet to implement
* Using Decimal numbers.
* Can be improved by adding other functions like sqrt, log, abs, square and power functions.
* The trig functions are casted to integers, to use the Evaluate class to evaluate every operation.
=> if for eah trig function we write an individual function than this can be avoided.
